# Tomat

### Silesian Pomodoro. 

Tomat is a basic time tracking app. 
It opens a window on your machine, which contains 3 tabs: work tab, short break tab, long break tab. 
You may start tracking your time with start button on the left, and stop any time with stop button on the right.

To start using Tomat on your machine, follow these instructions:
1. Ensure you are using python 3 to run this program, as Python 3.8 was used to write it. You may:
  - check if you already are using python3 as default
  `python --version`
  - OR find a path to python3 and use this full path in your commands: 
  `which python3`
2. Create and activate virtual environment:
  ```virtualenv -p your/path/to/python3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate
  ```
3. Check out the repository:
  `git clone https://github.com/awbox/tomat`
4. Install requirements:
  `pip3 install requirements.txt`
5. Execute main module to start the app:
  `python3 main.py`
